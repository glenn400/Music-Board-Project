# Music-Board-Project
Created a music board using a FPGA board, a circuit, keyboard and speakers
The Music Board

The idea of creating a keyboard that can output music notes at various frequencies like an
actual piano is an idea worth pursing and in Digital Design Lab I was able to pursue this idea.
Using the knowledge acquired over the span of the quarter implementing this project was time
consuming and fairly difficult. The idea was to use user input from a keyboard and map it to
keys around the middle “A” frequency which is around four hundred and forty hertz. The project
needed very few parts and acquiring them was not a hard task and implementing them was
straight forward. Creating a state diagram was fairly straight forward, but through unseen errors I
had to quickly change methods and approach the project differently. This project shows
understanding of using the FPGA board and the possibilities of using Verilog to create a program
that acts as a circuit in hardware. Programming in Verilog has its benefits and having the FPGA
to work off of made approaching this task a lot simpler than it would have in other situations.
